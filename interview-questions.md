Your answer: In a pair programming there is the Driver who is typing the code and then there is the Naviator telling the Driver what to write for coding.

Researched answer: The Pair Programming technique involves two people working on a single block of code, one driving the process and providing a high level bird's eye view of the steps called the Navigator. With the counterpart literally typing out the code and taking take care of the semantics called the Driver.
